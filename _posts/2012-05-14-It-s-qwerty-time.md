For few time, people don't stop telling me that for coding, nothing is
better than Qwerty keyboard. 

As I don't the stupid guy who never try out and still tell everyone: 
"_nothing is better than azerty!!_" so I'm trying it. To be precise, as
an French guy, I'm trying a US internationalize keyboard.

For the moment I'm a bit slower, don't stop looking at its fingers. But
it seems pretty cool for coding. I will try a bit more after, within an
'Archiva coding night'n day session'.

Thks.
