<p>For many years now, I have a Jenkins running at home, for my personal projects.
The problem is that, it&rsquo;s running on my laptop.
So, I basically have a setup where Jenkins tells me &ldquo;it works on [your] computer&rdquo;.
This is far from ideal.</p>

<h2 id="following-home-s-lab">Following home&rsquo;s lab</h2>

<p>There are 2 articles I read recently which gave me the motivation to have a proper setup at home.
Few days ago, the excellent Jessie Frazelle wrote a post about labs at home.
If you have read it, pause here and go read it: <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/home-lab-is-the-dopest-lab/">Home Lab is the Dopest Lab</a>.
Few weeks ago, Carolyn Van Slyck wrote a suite of articles on how she used NUCs to create her DVDs digitalization pipeline. Same thing, go read her articles, they are excellent: <a href="http://carolynvanslyck.com/blog/2017/10/my-little-cluster/">My Little Cluster Story</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-connection">What&rsquo;s the connection?</h2>

<p>Well, my Jenkins is my lab.
I use it to build side project, to experiment.
But I don&rsquo;t have it running all the time.
For example, at the time I write this line, I haven&rsquo;t started it for 4weeks..</p>

<p>So I want to setup it correctly.
I could simply buy a NUC and install Jenkins on it.
That would be it.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;d like to leverage the NUC to run my side projects as well.
So Kubernetes.</p>

<h2 id="why-kubernetes">Why Kubernetes?</h2>

<p>First, everyone&rsquo;s speaking about it.
Second, I might need to understand it, use it for my job.
Third, why not?</p>

<p>So, before buying anything, I&rsquo;ll setup a minikube instance on my laptop (again).
Make sure I can really use and understand K8S (as the cool kids say).
Then I&rsquo;ll setup properly a NUC with my Jenkins.
I&rsquo;ll see after that if I need more of them.</p>

<p>So yes, at first it&rsquo;ll be a one node k8s cluster..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to &ldquo;document&rdquo; my experiment here.
It won&rsquo;t be glorious (like if anyone read this..) but it might worth the time, so I make sure I do understand what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
