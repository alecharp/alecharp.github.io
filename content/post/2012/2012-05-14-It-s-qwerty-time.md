For a while, people haven't stopped telling me that for coding, nothing is
better than a Qwerty keyboard. 

As I am not the stupid guy who never tries out and still tells everyone: 
"_nothing is better than azerty!!_", I'm trying it. To be specific, as
an French guy, I'm trying a US internationalized keyboard.

For the moment I'm a bit slower, can't stop looking at my fingers. But
it seems pretty cool for coding. I will try a bit more after, within an
'Archiva coding night'n day session'.

Thks.
