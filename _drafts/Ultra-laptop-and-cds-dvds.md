Recently, my sister-in-law bought a new ultra laptop. First thing to notice, like Apple recent laptops, there is no CD / DVD input. That's fair, I mean, we download __legally__ everything now.

But when you need to re-install your laptop, how do you do this? Back in my youth (not that far away!), laptops were shipped with a CD or a DVD to be able to (re)install Windows. You could have a lot of reason to do so: you want to have both Windows and Linux, you changed the hard-drive (in favor to a SSD)..

As you don't have a CD/DVD input, manufacturer stop to do this. Where is your way to choose what to install on your brand new laptop now? What is the cost to ship a bootable USB stick to install Windows, or what ever OS that your laptop had?

Please, someone, explain this to me!
